# Drum-Kit
Hey! This is a simple Drum Kit project I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s an interactive webpage where you can play drum sounds by either clicking on the buttons or pressing specific keys on your keyboard.
What it does:
Click to Play: Click on any drum button, and it will make the corresponding sound.
Keyboard Support: You can also press keys w, a, s, d, j, k, or l to play different drum sounds.
Cool Animation: When you play a sound, the button lights up for a moment to show it’s active.
How I made it:
I used event listeners to detect button clicks and key presses.
The drum sounds are played using the Audio object in JavaScript.
There’s a small animation effect created by adding and removing a CSS class.
It’s a fun little project where you can make your own beats. Hope you enjoy it! 😊

(It’s hosted online, so you can try it directly and create your own beats!)

Hope you enjoy it! 😊
